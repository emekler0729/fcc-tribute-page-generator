## Page Generator

### Purpose

The original purpose of this project was to generated a tribute page for the freeCodeCamp Front End Development exercise. To challenge myself, I decided to separate the content and layout of the tribute page by developing a small script which would take an HTML template and fill in the placeholders in the template from a content JSON object. After completing the challenge, I realized this concept could be extended to generalize the generation of pages from template and content information.

### Current Functionality

Takes the static index.html page as a template and fills the placeholders in the template with data in the hard-coded path in the index page.

### Feature Ideas

- [ ] Generate output from arbitrary template and content.
